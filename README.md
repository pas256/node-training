Help a brother out. These are OSX instructions.

First step is to install node using brew:

    brew install node

Then test if it is working:

    node --version

You will probably see something like `v0.12.0` returned.

Then run the hello world program:

    node hello-world.js

Did you see `Hello World` printed out? Good.
